A list view displays events in a simple vertical list for a specific interval of time. 

 If there are no events during a specific interval of time, the “No events to display” screen is displayed, 

 views: {
          listDay: { buttonText: 'list day' },
          listWeek: { buttonText: 'list week' }
        },
-> displays a list view for day as well as week
